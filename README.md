# c-password-program
 This is a program to check if you have entered a right password or not.

 So here the program is all about a login interface using C language, i made this program just for begginers who can get how the medium level of c program is also gonna explain what's the process and how the code is executed.

 So first we have to declair header file name as "#include<stdio.h>" also we have to include a header file which contains string library functions ex: "#include<string.h>".

 Then we have to start the main part of the body. Then inside main we have to declare a charecter tyope array.

Then we have to start reading password elements from user like we will ask user to w=enter their user name and password.

After that we have to start the "if else  " in which our progam is going to be executed according to the condition =s we passed to our statements, itn the very first loop we have used a string library function which is "strcmp" is used to commpare two credentials with predefined ones if the got match with your credentials the the meessage ill be printed "correct password word", and if password is not correct the loop will go for else statement and the the message will be printed that the "password is incorrect".

Hope this Helps You...
